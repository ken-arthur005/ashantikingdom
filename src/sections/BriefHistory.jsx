            realized that unifying the separate Asante kingdoms was essential to resist the powerful Denkyira neighbors to the south. <br/>
            With the help of Okomfo Anokye, his chief priest and adviser, <br/>
            he established the Asante Kingdom around 1701, with the Golden Stool as the sole unifying symbol.
